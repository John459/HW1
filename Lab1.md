1.a Line 4 is bounded in line 3.Line 7 is bounded in line 1
1.b  Line 3 is bounded in line 2.Line 6 is bounded in line 2. Line 10 is bounded in line 8.Line 13 is bounded in line 1

2. g is well-typed with type ((Int, Int), Int)
(b,1): ((Int, Int), Int) because
	b: (Int, Int) because
		x: Int
		3: Int
	1: Int
(b, a + 2): ((Int, Int), Int) because
	b: (Int, Int) because
		x: Int
		3: Int
	a + 2: Int because
		a: Int
		2: Int
